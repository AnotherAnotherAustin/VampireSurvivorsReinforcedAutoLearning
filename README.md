# Vampire Survivors Reinforced Auto Learning
Repo that houses all the required files for an automated reinforced learning algorithm that views a working game of Vampire Survivors and gradually improves its play style using a simple reward-consequence ML algorithm. This was the final project of Austin Schlake for EE-595: Applied Artificial Intelligence.
